This will happen each time you enter into a transaction with a retailer, and will happen in other circumstances (such as when you use a price- or quote-comparison service).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each retailer or other business to which you provide your personal data will have its own practices concerning users' privacy. Those retailers and businesses are independent of Quidco, so you should check their privacy terms to make sure you are happy with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;content-group&quot;&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;our-sharing&quot;&gt;Our sharing of information about you with others&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;We like to understand our Account Holders interests as well as we can, in order to personalise the offers we make to them through the Quidco Service as much as possible.

This type of information includes, for example, usage of an Account Holder's Cashback Receipt Method, such as the types of product that the individual Account Holder purchases and the value of those purchases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, Quidco will also share data with trusted 3rd parties to enable our instore program to correctly track your Qualifying Transactions and related Referral Fees:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;bulleted&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;By registering the number of your credit card and/or debit card and/or charge card (&quot;Identifier Card Numbers&quot;) in the Quidco Programme, you hereby authorise us to disclose your Identifier Card Numbers to&amp;nbsp;businesses which assist Quidco by associating with your Account certain in-store purchases you may make (we call them &ldquo;Transactional Service Providers&rdquo;), to retailers or their suppliers (even if you never use the Identifier Card Numbers with one or more of those retailers) to identify and calculate sums which may contribute to your Balance and otherwise as appropriate in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Policy and acknowledge that we and&amp;nbsp;Transactional Service Providers&amp;nbsp;on our behalf, will collect any and all information from any retailer, merchant acquirer, credit card processor, issuing bank, or any other available source with respect to the purchases made using your Identifier Card Numbers.

You must take the time to read and understand it before registering for the Quidco Service. By registering, you accept that you are entering into a contract with us on the terms of this Agreement. You should be aware that this Agreement may change from time to time in accordance with Clause 16 below. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who register for the Quidco Service establish an &quot;Account&quot;, and become &quot;Account Holders&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;content-group&quot;&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;aha-quidco-service&quot;&gt;The Quidco Service&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Quidco Service allows Account Holders to make purchases from retailers which may qualify for cashback.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how it works. Quidco receives a commission (the &quot;Referral Fee&quot;), payable by a retailer, for purchases made by an Account Holder from the retailer, once that retailer has confirmed the purchase (each a &quot;Qualifying Transaction&quot;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Account Holders who have entered into Qualifying Transactions for which Referral Fees have been received by us will be able to see a positive account balance on their Account (a &ldquo;Balance&rdquo;). That Balance will be converted into a payment to you (&ldquo;Cashback&rdquo;) when the Account Holder requests payment of the Balance. To be clear, a Balance does not itself represent a sum of money held by Quidco on an Account Holder&rsquo;s behalf.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See Clause 4 for more about Cashback.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we refer to retailers, we mean sellers and suppliers of goods or services that agree to enter into Qualifying Transactions and pay us Referral Fees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quidco Compare: We are required by our regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to provide all Account Holders who are users of Quidco Compare with our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quidco.com/qco-compare-fsaPager.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Initial Disclosure Document&lt;/a&gt;.
